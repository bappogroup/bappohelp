# Clone and Merge your Space

### Create a Clone of your Space

A Clone is a copy of the structure of the Space and does not contain any of your data in the original Space. By Cloning your Space you are able to use the same layout of the original Space, creating another Space for new data or other records

1. Select the ‘Modify Space’ button at the bottom left of the screen
2. Click on the ‘Space Design’ tool
3. Select ‘Space Settings’
4. In the ‘Basic Settings’ tab, select ‘Clone Space’
5. Give the Space a name and you now have Clone of your Space

### Merge your new changes to your original Space

Any changes you make to the structure of your Cloned Space can be merged to the original Space. Making changes to the Cloned Space allows you to make mistakes and edit the structure before you decide to implement it into the original \(The changes could include coding also\).  To merge your new changes:

1. In 'Space Design' select 'Basic Settings'
2. Underneath 'Clone Space' you should see 'Merge Space to \(name of original App\)'
3. Select 'Merge' and your original Space will contain the changes made.
