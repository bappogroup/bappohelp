# Create a Folder for your Files

You can create as many folders as you like in your File Manager and drag your Files into them

1. Once you are in File Manager select 'Create Folder'
2. Name the folder and click on 'Create Folder' in the popup box
3. Once your folder has been created, simply drag the files on your page over the top of the folder and they will move inside
4. If you click on the folder the files you have dragged in their will be visible

Note: To put files into your folders, you can either drag them in if they are already in your File Manager or you can click on the 'Upload File' button when you are inside the folder to upload straight into the folder.
