# Required and Unique switches

### Required switch

If you turn this switch on, it means that every record that you create will need to have this field filled in before the record is created. For example: You may have a 'Date Field' that has the required switch on. So, you wont be able to complete the records you create without entering in the date for that record.  
The required switch is useful if you want to force users to enter the required data into the field. But remember that you will not be able to save the record until this data has been entered.

### Unique switch

If you turn this switch on, then every time you create a record this particular field entry must be different from every other record. For example: If it's a "Phone Number Field' then the phone number you enter into your new record cannot be the same phone number as you have entered in previous records.
