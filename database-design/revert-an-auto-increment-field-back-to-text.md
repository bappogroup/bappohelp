# Revert an auto-increment field back to text



If you've set a field to auto-increment, you can always revert it back to text.  


1. In the [Database Builder](http://help.bappo.com/database-use/switch-between-user-mode-and-design-mode) on the left, select the name field e.g. ‘Invoice Name’
2. Turn on the checkbox ‘Convert the field back to text’ 
3. Enter a new field name. This may be the same as the existing field name.
4. Click on ‘Convert’
5. You should see the ‘Conversion succeeded!’ message
6. Exit the ‘Edit Field’ popup and your records will auto increment
