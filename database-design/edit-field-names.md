# Edit Field Names

To edit and change the name of your fields, here’s an example:

1. Select an object such as ‘Customers’
2. Click on the name field ‘Customer Name’
3. A popup box ‘Edit Field - Customer Name’ will appear
4. Click on the pencil item next to ‘Customer Name’
5. Change the field name, press the accept mark, exit the popup and the field name will have changed

Note: You will notice that the technical name of the field has not changed. All forms will show the new name, but developers will use the technical name during coding.
