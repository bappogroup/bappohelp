# Create and Delete Objects

Each table is called an Object. Objects are the basic components of your database and the first things you will create when you start your database. An Object is something you can define and describe. For example a contact person is an Object. Eventually you will create records in the Object.  
  
As an example, your Object might be called 'Customers' and therefore each record under this Object is a specific customer.

### Create Objects

1. In the Database Builder, click on 'Create New Object' on the left panel
2. Name the Object and select 'Create New Object'
3. Your Object should be created and you are now ready to add fields and create records.

Note: The Object name will always become a plural. If you type in 'Customer' it will always become 'Customers'. If you type in 'Person' it will automatically create as 'People'. This is because it is the group name of your records.

### Delete Objects

1. In the Database Builder, click on the Object you want to delete in the left design panel
2. Click on the little bin icon at the bottom right of the selected object
3. Your Object will be deleted with all of the records connected to that Object
