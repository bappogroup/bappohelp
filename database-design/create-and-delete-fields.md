# Create and Delete Fields

After you have created Objects in your Space, you can create fields under those Objects. There are a range of different types of fields you can choose from. The more fields you create under your Object, the more fields you will fill in when you create records. 

Note: When you create an Object, it will automatically create a 'Name' field. 

### Create a Field

1. In the the Database Builder on the left, click on the Object you want to add more fields to
2. Select 'Add New field' underneath the Object
3. Type in the Name of the field and choose the type of field you want to create
4. Click on 'Save' and your field should be created

### Delete a Field

1. In the Database Builder on the left, click on the Object that contains the field you want to delete
2. Click on the chosen field
3. Select 'Delete field' at the bottom of the pop up.
4. Your field should be deleted

Note: If you delete a field, all the records that have information using that field will be deleted too. For example, If you create 20 Projects, and you decide to delete the 'Date' field that you created, all the dates that you have assigned to each project will be deleted. However the projects and the remaining fields will still exist.
