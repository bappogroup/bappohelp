# Switch between User mode and the Database Builder

When you create a new Space, you land in the Database Builder \(on the left\).

From here, you can switch to User mode, by clicking on the "Go to this App" button on the bottom left of the the Database Builder.

Similarly when you are in User mode, you can switch to the Database Builder by clicking on the "Modify Space" button at the bottom of the User Panel to the left of the screen.
