# Many to Many Relationship

### Many to Many Relationship

This relationship can be explained using the following example:

You want to connect each ingredient to more than one recipe. You also want your recipes to connect with more than one ingredient. 

This is a many to many relationship. Here's how to do this:

1. Click on 'Add New Relationship' in the Database Builder under one of the Objects you want to create the relationship with on the left. 
2. In the dropdown box in the popup, select the other Object that you want in this relationship
3. Change both words to 'Many'

It should look something like this:

* Each Ingredient connects with **Many** Recipes
* Each Recipe connects with **Many** Ingredients

Now when you click on a record in one of these Objects, you can make a connection with records from the other object by clicking on the tab. So, using the example we have, I can connect as many ingredients to as many recipes as I like.
