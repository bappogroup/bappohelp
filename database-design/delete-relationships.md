# Delete Relationships

You are able to delete a relationship from either of the two associated Objects

1. Once you are in the [Database Builder](http://help.bappo.com/database-use/switch-between-user-mode-and-design-mode) click on one of the Objects with the relationship attached.
2. Underneath the Object, you will see a heading called 'RELATIONSHIPS'. You can select the relationship here. If you click on the other Object in the relationship, you will also see the relationship underneath the same heading and you can delete it from here as well. The relationship under both Objects  should say something like this:

* Relates to many... 
* Relates to one... 

To delete:

1. Once you click on the relationship you want to delete a pop up will appear
2. Select 'Delete' on the bottom of the popup
3. Your relationship should be deleted

Note: Any connections that you have made between records will be lost. The rest of your data in each record will still exist however any associations with the other Object in the relationships will be deleted.
