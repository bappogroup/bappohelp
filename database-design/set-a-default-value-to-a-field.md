# Set a Default Value to a Field

If a field has a default, you can set up that default value You can either leave it or change it. Let's say you have an Object named 'Projects' and because we're in the year 2018 you want to set the default value of the 'Year' field to 2018. This is so you don't have to type 2018 every single time you create a new project. Once it rolls over to 2019, you can change this default value.

To set the default value:

1. Click on the field you want to set a default value to
2. Click on the little pencil icon next to 'Default Value' 
3. Type in the default value \(Note: If you have set this field to Time or Month etc. then you will be choosing the default from time stamp or the month of the year. If it's a text field you can type the default value.\)
4. Click on the tick icon on the right hand side of the pop-up next to where you just entered in the default value.
5. Now when you create a new record, the default value for this field will appear automatically.

Note: If you have created records before you set up a default value, it will not change the value of existing records. The default value will appear whenever you create a new record.
