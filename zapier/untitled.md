# Connect Bappo with Zapier

Bappo is now available on [Zapier](https://zapier.com/)! However we are still in Beta Version. To connect Bappo as an account use the link below and you will be able to make a Zap with Bappo just like your other apps. 

[Click here to connect Bappo](https://zapier.com/platform/public-invite/2319/be86e50371878779fd87974789960bb0/)

If you don't have a Zapier account and have never used Zapier before, [Zapier Help Files](https://zapier.com/help/features/) may be able to assist you in making Zaps between your apps, including Bappo.

Start a chat with us if you have any questions.
