# How to create a limited list of options

You may want to create a list of options that your users can choose from, but you want to limit how many they can choose. At the same time, their order of preference may also be important to you \(i.e. first choice, second choice, third choice etc.\).  
  
Let's say you provide tertiary education and want to match school leavers to their course of choice. You may give each applicant only five choices and you want to know the order of their preferences.

In this case you will actually create the relationship between the object "Applicant" and the object "Course" five times and each time you'll give each relationship a unique display name e.g.  
Preferred Course 1st choice  
Preferred Course 2nd choice  
Preferred Course 3rd choice  
Preferred Course 4th choice  
Preferred Course 5th choice

This will also enable you to create workflows e.g  
If no spaces available in "Preferred Course 1st choice", offer "Preferred Course 2nd choice".
