# Quit Conversation

When you are an active participant in a general chat or a chat about a record, you receive notifications about that conversation.

If you want to quit a conversation:

1. Click on the Settings icon in the top right hand corner.
2. In the dropdown box, click on 'Quit conversation'.

You will now be removed from the conversation and you will not be able to see it in your chat panel.

You will still be able to see the full chat about a record, but you won't receive notifications about that chat anymore.

Note: You cannot quit a conversation with only two participants in it. For example, If you start a one on one chat with another user you will not be able to remove that user or remove yourself \(otherwise there would only be one user in a chat\).
