# Change the name of a Chat

Here's how to rename your chat:

1. Open the conversation you want to rename.
2. Click on the Chat Settings icon in the top right hand corner
3. In the dropdown, select 'Rename'.
4. Type in the new name of your Chat and click on 'Done'.

The name of your chat should now be successfully changed.

Note: You cannot rename a conversation with only two participants. So, if you have a one on one conversation with another user you cannot rename this.
