# Start a Chat with other Users

Bappo allows you to chat on a personal level and in a group with the users you add to your Space. Chat has many features such as emojis, the ability to upload images, videos and files, history of all your previous chats and more. To start a chat:

1. Select the chat bubble at the top right of the screen.
2. Click on the ‘New Message’ icon.
3. A pop-up will appear on your screen titled ‘Select Recipients’. You can either type a name or an email address in the search bar or you can select users from the list below.
4. You can also type an email of anybody that is not yet in the list of recipients. This will invite them to the chat and to your Space.
5. Once you have finished selecting one or multiple users, click on ‘Done’.
6. Your chat with the users you selected is set up. Start typing and your chat will begin! 

If there is already a chat between your selected users, you will see the conversation history and your chat will simply add to the existing chat.
