# Chat about a Record

You can chat with other users about records in each Object. For example, you might have a list of projects in your ‘Projects’ tab and you might want to chat with a user about one of the projects. Another example could be that you may want to chat with another user about a particular Customer in your ‘Customer’ records. Using the latter example, here’s how to chat about a customer

1. Select ‘Customers’.
2. Select the customer you want to chat about.
3. On the bottom of the customer's file, click on ‘Chat about customers name’.
4. Now that you have a chat, select the ‘Chat Settings’ icon, add the Participants you want in the chat and start chatting.

Note: All users that have access to the record, have access to the chat. But only the Participants that you have added, will get a notification about the chat.

If there is an existing chat about the record, the conversation history will appear.
