If you start a chat you can add users into the chat who are already using your App. Also, you can invite new users to your App by just adding them to a chat. To do this:

1. Start a Chat - either about a record or with other users
2. Select the 'Chat Settings' icon in the top right hand corner
3. Click on 'Add Participants'
4. Select 'Invite Users'
5. Type in the email address of the person you want to invite
6. Click on 'Invite new User'
7. The User will now be invited to your Space as well as the selected chat.
