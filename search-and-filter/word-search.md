# Word Search

You can find records by doing a word search either to find one record or to find many. The records listed on your screen will contain the same words in your search. Here’s an example: If you wanted to find all the customers that have the word ‘Happy’ in their record you would:

1. Select your object ‘Customers’
2. In the search bar above your records type ‘Happy’
3. All the records displayed will contain the word ‘Happy’ somewhere in their file
