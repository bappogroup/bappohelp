# Search by Tag

### Search by Tag

Having tags attached to your records makes it a lot easier to find what your looking for when searching for something specific. Using the previous example where we created a tag ‘Bappo’ to indicate the company the contact is from, now we can search by this tag to find the records listed with this tag

1. Select your object, in this case ‘Customers’
2. In the search bar type ‘\#’
3. Once you start typing a blue box should outline your writing
4. Type ‘\#Bappo’ and click ‘Enter’ on your keyboard
5. The list of records displayed on your screen will all have a tag ‘Bappo’ in their file

To understand this further, lets say you want to group all the Contacts from the company Bappo who work in Accounting:

1. You already have a tag ‘Bappo’ in these records so you would add a second tag called ‘Accounting’.
2. Now, if you want to find these Contacts you would type the two tags in the search bar at the same time.
3. Your search bar would look like \#Bappo \#Accounting
4. The records displayed on your screen will have both the tags in each of them and you have now found the Contacts from Bappo who are in Accounting
