# Search by Field

Searching records by Field allows you to be more specific in your findings. As an example, you may want to find all the customers with the last name ‘Smith’. By this stage you would already have ‘Customers’ as your object and Field names such as ‘First Name’, ‘Last Name’, ‘Phone Number’ etc. Here’s how you would search by Field using the same example:

1. Select ‘Customers’
2. In the search bar type in the Field name you want to search by, in this case ‘Last Name’
3. In the drop down box you should see ‘Search by Field’ and underneath ‘Last Name:text’.
4. Select ‘Last Name:text’ and a little box in your search bar should appear with ‘Last Name:’
5. Type in ‘Smith’ and press enter. You search bar should look like this - Last Name:smith
6. The records that are listed will all have the last name ‘Smith’
