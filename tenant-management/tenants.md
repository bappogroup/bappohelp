# Tenants

### What is a Tenant?

You have created a beautiful, powerful Space on the Bappo platform. You have shown it to a few friends and customers. Everybody loves it. And now customers are queueing to use your Space. Bappo makes it easy to roll out your Space. Each customer will become a Tenant. A Tenant is a way to keep two or more sets of records separate. In other words, two Tenants use exactly the same infrastructure \(application\), but they do not share any data.  Think of it as an apartment building. You have created and moved into the ground floor. With the click of a button, you can add an unlimited number of floors and give each Tenant a security pass to enter their level. And if you renovate or add a feature to the ground floor, all Tenants will immediately receive the new feature. And they may not even know about each other's  existence. 

### How to create a Tenant?

1. Go into the Database Builder on the left and click on the 'Space Design' icon on the bottom left.
2. Click on 'Tenants'
3. Click on  the 'New Tenant' button
4. Type the Tenant name in the box and click on 'Create Tenant'

You should see your Tenant on your screen with your original Tenant.  
If you go back to your back to the Space, you will now see Tenant information in you Space Management dropdown box in the top left corner.

### What if two or more Tenants have the same users?

If you are the Space owner, you will be a user in every Tenant you create. Any other user can be added to other Tenants. 

If you go to User mode you can switch between Tenants:

1. Click on the Space Management dropdown. It is the arrow in the top left in User mode
2. Now you will see an option at the bottom of the dropdown list under the heading 'Tenants'
3. Click on the new Tenant you just created and your Space will switch over to this Tenant.

### When will you add a Tenant?

1. Different organisations: The most common use of Tenants is to leverage your application by selling it to other people or organisations. You can create a new Tenant for each entitity. In future we will have a feature to allow Tenants to add themselves.
2. Testing and/or Training: If you want to test your Space or train people to use your Space, you can create Tenants specifically for that purpose. You can delete the Tenant at any time.
3. Segregated Projects: You may have different projects that have the same structure, but they don't share any data \(not even customer data\). They may or may not have the same users. 
4. Different users: You have very specific user groups. You may have a business-specific application where you and each of your customers collaborate on a project. You likely share confidential data. Or you don't want to clutter screens with data that's not relevant to this work. You can create a Tenant for each customer. 

### How many Tenants can I add?

Unlimited

### When will I rather Clone the Space?

A Tenant cannot make custom changes. Only the developer can change the Space. If you want to modify the Space without effecting the original Space, it's better to [create a clone](http://help.bappo.com/app-management/clone-and-merge-your-app) and modify the clone.
