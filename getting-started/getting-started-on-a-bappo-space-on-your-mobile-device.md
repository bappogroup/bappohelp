# Getting started on a Bappo space on your mobile device

## Our conversations are more important than we think

Online conversations are often the place where ideas are generated and shared; where decisions are made; where we share information and content; and where we engage with customers, suppliers, colleagues and friends. Bappo lets you transform all your online conversations into a searchable, useable business asset by enabling you to add structure and data. Gone are the days when you have to search through the whole thread of the conversation to find the important information and content.

## Create a New Account

1. To create a new account, simply install Bappo on your mobile device.
2. Click on ‘Sign Up’
3. Fill in your name, surname, email address and password.

You will receive an email to verify your account within 7 days.

## Create a New Space

The first screen you’ll see is your home screen for all your Spaces.

In each Space you will have conversations with a common purpose. You can create as many Spaces as you want, but you may want to consider how you can expand your Space to share common data among conversations.

1. To create a new Space, click on the grey ‘New Space’ box in the top left. It has a ‘+’ symbol.
2. Choose a short name for your Space that best defines the purpose or group of the conversations.

## Invite Users

To create the group or team that will participate in the conversations, you’ll need to invite Users.

1. Click on the menu icon in the top left of the screen.
2. Click on the ‘User’ icon.
3. Click on the the ‘+ Invite User’ button at the bottom of the screen.
4. Enter the email address of the new user.

Each user will now receive an invitation to join your Space.

## Start a Conversation

You are now able to start a general conversation with one or more users.

1. Click on the chat icon in the top right of your screen.
2. Click on the red ‘+’ icon at the bottom of the screen.
3. Select your conversation partners.
4. Type your first message; or send and image or file; or take a photo with your phone’s camera.

## Manage a Conversation

When you open a conversation the second time, you’ll see the Settings icon in the top-right hand corner of the chat. This is where you can

* Change the conversation name \(if there are more than two participants\)
* Add more participants to the chat \(once they have been added as users\)
* Quit the conversation

## Create a Database

### Create a New Object

Many conversations are about something that you can define and describe. We call it an object. A group of related objects is a database. When you decide it’s time to add structure to your conversations, you’ll start to organise the data in objects. Eventually you will create records, each record being a specific instance of an object.

1. Click on the menu icon in the top left hand corner
2. Select ‘Modify Database’
3. Click on the ‘+ Create New Object’ icon
4. Type in the name of the Object and press ‘Create Object’ in the top right.

### Add a Field

The characteristics of the object are called fields. For a contact person, you may create fields for the name, job description, phone number and email address. Each field has a field type including: text, phone number, email, multiline text, checkbox, currency amount, month, year, date, fixed list, quantity and time.

1. Click on the menu icon in the top left corner
2. Select ‘Modify Database’
3. Click on the object
4. Select ‘Add New Field’ at the bottom of the screen in the orange button.
5. Name the field
6. Click on the ‘Field Type’ box and select from the list
7. Select whether the field should be unique or required by sliding the toggle button on or off.
8. In the top right-hand corner click on ‘Create Field’

### Add a Field with a Relationship to Other Objects

You may have already noticed that when you create a new field you also have the other objects included in the list of field types. This allows you to easily create a relationship between objects.

1. Click on the menu option in the top left corner.
2. Select ‘Modify Database’
3. Select the object where you want the field to appear.
4. Click on the ‘+ Add New Field’ button
5. Name the field
6. Select the reference object as ‘Field Type’
7. Click on ‘Create Field’

### Edit a Field

Once you have added a field, you can edit the field, delete the field or switch the unique or required buttons.

You are not able to change the field type. If you have selected the wrong field type, just delete the field and add a new field.

## Add Content e.g. Files and Images

Any content that you have uploaded in a conversation can be organised in an object. You do this by adding a new field to your record and selecting ‘File’ as the field type.

When you create a new record, you will have a list of available images to attach to this record.

## Chat about the Record

Once you’ve created a record, you are able to add tags, edit the record, delete the record or chat about the record.

When you chat about a record, the conversation is aware of its context. This makes the conversation available to anyone who has permission to view the record. It also makes it easy to retrieve the conversation: you can just go back to the record.

When you click on the chat icon in the top right, you will see a list of recent conversations. This makes it easy to access the conversation, without having to open the record.

You can also add participants to the record. This will allow these participants to get notifications.

1. Click in the settings icon to the right of the conversation name
2. Click on the ‘+’ symbol to add participants

You can also quit the conversation or rename the conversation from this screen.

If you quit the conversation, you will still be able to see the conversation about the record, but you won’t receive any more notifications about this conversation.

## Search

You can do a search on records if you go into an object. Okay, that is not really special, we know. What about all those tags you have added? The team at Bappo is working hard to bring you a powerful search engine.

## User Roles

To protect your space, you may want to delete users or manage user roles

1. Click on the menu option in the top left corner.
2. Select ‘Users’. A list of users will appear.
3. Select any of the users or search to find the user.
4. In the 'User Attributes’ tab you can delete the user by clicking on ‘Delete User’
5. In the ‘User roles’ tab you can make the user an administrator by switching the radio button on.
6. In the future you will also be able to define and assign roles to users to control their access to records and content.

Enjoy your space. It is a place where you and your team can chat, create, plan, process, decide, take notes, file and play. And remember that individuals and interactions are more important than tools and processes.
