# How do I get started?

## Sign up to Bappo

1. Go to [bappo.com](http://bappo.com/), click on Sign Up and follow the sign up instructions.
2. Once you have signed up successfully and logged into Bappo you should see a blank screen with only one button on it “Create New Space”.

## Create and Build Your Space

Click on the “Create a new Space” button, give your Space a name and click on “Go”. Congratulations you have created your Space! Let’s start building.  


### 1. Create Objects

Objects are collections of records such as ‘Customers’ or ‘Contacts’.

For example:

* Create an object and name it Customer.
* Create another object and name it Contacts.

**2. Create Fields Under Objects**

Fields are created under objects and used to store data. Each type of data is stored in its own type of field. The name field, for example ‘Contact Name’ is already created for you when you create an object.

For example:

* Now add some fields to Contacts - Select ‘Add New Field’, choose the name of your field such as ‘Comments’ or ‘Email’ and the type of field you want \(e.g. text field, quantity field\)

**3. Create a Relationship**

Create relationships between objects e.g. one Customer has many Contacts

For example:

* Expand the Customer object on the left, and click on ‘Add New Relationship’. As an example; select target object to be Contacts. The screen should now read as follows:

Click ‘Add Relationship’ and your two objects, in this case Contacts and Customers, now have a relationship with each other
