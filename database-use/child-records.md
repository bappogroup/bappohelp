# Child Records

The ‘one’ side of a relationship is called the ‘Parent’ side and the ‘many’ side is called the ‘Child’ side, e.g. in the relationship between Customers and Contacts \(where one Customer relates to many Contacts\), Customers is the Parent object while Contacts is the Child object.

Child records can be created from a tab on the Parent page. For example, here’s how to create a Child record

1. Select the object ‘Customers’ \(parent object\)
2. Select the Customer you want to create the Child record for
3. You should see two tabs on the page, ‘Customer attributes’ and ‘Contacts’
4. Click on ‘Contacts’
5. Select ‘Create New Contact’
6. Fill in all the fields and press ‘Save’
7. You have now created a Child record. If you navigate into ‘Contacts’ you will also be able to see the new Contact together with all your other Contacts.
